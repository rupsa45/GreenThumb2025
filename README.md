## 🧑‍🌾 User Flow

1. User selects or types:
- `City Name` (e.g., "Kolkata")

2. Request sent to the backend (example payload):
```json
[
{ "crop": "papaya" },
{ "crop": "chickpea" },
{ "crop": "jute" },
{ "crop": "mungbean" },
{ "crop": "banana" },
{ "crop": "pomegranate" }
]
```

3. Backend processes crop-wise data and returns the predicted prices, which are visualized in the frontend.
